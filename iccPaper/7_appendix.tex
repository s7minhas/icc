\subsection*{Comparison with ordinal logit}

For ordinal variables such as the CIRI components the choice of a fit statistic is not as obvious. We use Somer's $D$, a rank correlation coefficient  \citep{Somers1962}, as our discrepancy statistic for the ordinal logit models.
Somer's $D$ is closely related to Goodman and Kruskal's $\gamma$ and Kendall's $\tau$, differing only in the denominator.\footnote{Somer's $D$ is similar to the commonly used $\tau_b$, which is equal to $\frac{P - Q}{(P+Q+X_0)(P+Q+Y_0)}$, where $Y_0$ is the number of ties in $Y$, and $\gamma$, which is equal to $\frac{P - Q}{P + Q}$.} Somer's $D$ makes a distinction between the independent and dependent variable in a bivariate distribution, correcting for ties within the independent variable. With $Y$ being treated as the independent variable it is denoted $D_{xy}$.

Specifically:
$$D_{xy} = \frac{P - Q}{P + Q + X_0}$$

\noindent where $P$ is the number of concordant pairs, $Q$ is the number discordant pairs, and $X_0$ is the number of ties in $X$. This is simply a measure of association for ordinal variables, so our approach is essentially to calculate the correlation between predicted and observed values. Like all correlation coefficients, the $D$ statistic lies in the interval $[-1, 1]$, with values closer to $1$ indicating more rank agreement and values closer to $1$ indicated less rank agreement, so values closer to 0 indicate more prediction error. In the results section below we discuss how we use these performance measures to judge whether covariates add substantially to a model's predictive ability.
