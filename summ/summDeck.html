# Data

## DVs

- State
  + Prelim ICC Involvement
    * 18 countries experienced event between 2002 to 2016
  + Formal ICC Involvement
    * 5 countries experienced event between 2002 to 2016

- Opposition
  + Prelim ICC Involvement
    * 16 countries experienced event between 2002 to 2016
  + Formal ICC Involvement
    * 8 countries experienced event between 2002 to 2016

## IVs

- ICC ratification
- Africa region binary (static)
- GDP in constant dollars from World Bank (to 2017)
- Civil War &amp; OSV from UCDP (to 2016)
- Political Terror Scale (to 2016)
- Polity (to 2016)
- Lower and higher court independence measures from VDEM (to 2017)
- Referral data (static)

## P5+1 Measures

For each P5+1 measure, I calculate the average relationship between every country in the sample and also include individual variables designating the relation between a country and each of the P5+1 countries.

- Ideal points from Voeten (to 2015)
- Military intervention from UCDP (to 2016)

Other affinity measures with P5+1 countries that we discussed include alliances, joint IGO membership, and trade. Each of these variables has too short a time series. I have the SIPRI measure set up as well but am hesitant about using it for now because the level of missingness in the dataset exceeds 30%.

---

## Effective sample

- Lagging each of the IVs and P5+1 measures by one year provides us with an effective sample from 2002 to 2016. 
- Each of the control and key variables of interest come with degrees of missingness, but in no case do we have missingness for more than 10% of cases. 
- However, given that some of those missing cases will lead us to lose the already number of rare events that we have I imputed five missing datasets using a Bayesian copula scheme.

# Modeling

## Strategies

- We've discussed a number of modeling strategies:
  + Logit models estimated separately for prelim and formal stage
  + Logit model with temporal dependence taken into account using cubic splines (Carter &amp; Signorino, 2010)
  + Selection model to account for the conditional dependence between the formal and prelim stages
    * For now I've worked on using a Sartori's version of a selection model since we haven't discussed whether we have enough covariates to specify separate theories for the prelim and formal equations
  + Random forest models to aid in accounting for paucity of events

## Model specification

In general, the model specification I used for each of the above is:
    </textarea>
<script src="https://remarkjs.com/downloads/remark-latest.min.js"></script>
<script>var slideshow = remark.create({
"highlightStyle": "github",
"highlightLines": true,
"countIncrementalSlides": false
});
if (window.HTMLWidgets) slideshow.on('afterShowSlide', function (slide) {
  window.dispatchEvent(new Event('resize'));
});
(function() {
  var d = document, s = d.createElement("style"), r = d.querySelector(".remark-slide-scaler");
  if (!r) return;
  s.type = "text/css"; s.innerHTML = "@page {size: " + r.style.width + " " + r.style.height +"; }";
  d.head.appendChild(s);
})();</script>

<script type="text/x-mathjax-config">
MathJax.Hub.Config({
  tex2jax: {
    skipTags: ['script', 'noscript', 'style', 'textarea', 'pre']
  }
});
</script>
<!-- dynamically load mathjax for compatibility with self-contained -->
<script>
(function () {
  var script = document.createElement('script');
  script.type = 'text/javascript';
  script.src  = 'https://cdn.bootcss.com/mathjax/2.7.1/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML';
  if (location.protocol !== 'file:' && /^https?:/.test(script.src))
    script.src  = script.src.replace(/^https?:/, '');
  document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(script);
})();
</script>
  </body>
